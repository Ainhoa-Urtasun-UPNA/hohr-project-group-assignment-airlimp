## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.
***

In the present we are 4 workers on the firm, 2 managers, 1 engineer and 1 operator.  We are planning to hire workers  next year, so we need to predict the number of available workers in different occupations. In order to do so we used matrix multiplications. We have introduced the following data in payton. The matrix calculation is a bit complex, we need to take care of the order we dispose the numbers. 
 
 
    D = numpy.array([[15,0,0],[0,20,0],[0,0,50]]) 

    M = numpy.array([[5,2,0],[0,10,0],[5,5,45]])

    b = numpy.array([[2],[1],[1]])


The obtained results are the following: 

    0.76666667 - Managers

    0.5 - Engineers

    1.81666667 - Operators


As we are dealing with people, we need to round the numbers to integers. Therefore, the predicted number of managers is 1, 1 for engineers and 2 for operators. 

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.
***

In the last task we predicted the number of available workers in a year from now in our company. Today we are forecasting the firm's demand for workers and for that we follow a two-step process. Firstly, we estimate the coefficients by applying OLS regression. We have done so by using python (matrices). Secondly, we used those coefficients into the linear model to make the predictions.

The obtained results are the following:

    4.3333 - Managers
    
    12.45  - Engineers
    
    14.04 - Operators

As we are dealing with poeple, we have to round the numbers obtained to integers. Therefore, the predicted number of managers is 4, of engineers is 12 and of operators is 7.

Finally, we compare the predicted available workers with the predicted need for workers to detect mismatches. There is a shortage of 3 managers, a shortage of 11 engineers and a shortage of 5 operators. 

As the number of available workers is smaller than the demand, we should take an upsizing strategy to prevent these potential labor mismatches. As the difference is quite high, we should follow a strategy that is more radical, that would produce changes in the organization. We propose hiring these workers so that they become a part of the team.
